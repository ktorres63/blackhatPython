## Installing kali linux
When you've gone through the steps of the installation, may there been important updates since kali image was created, let's update the machine with the latest version 
`sudo apt update`
`sudo list --upgradable`
`sudo apt upgrade`
`sudo apt dist-upgrade`
`sudo apt autoremove`

## Setting up python3 
The version of python listed here is 3.10.8. If yours is lower than 3.5 upgrade your distribution with the following:

`sudo apt-get upgrade python3`

invoke pythonfrom the kali shell and have a look
`python3`

we will use python3 with a virtual enviroment, which is a self contained directory tree that includes a python installation and the set of any ectra packages you install. The virtual enviroment is among the most essential tools for a python developer. Using one you can separate projects that have different needs. For example, you might use one virtual enviroment for projects involving packet inspection and a different one for proyects on binary analysis

By having separate enviroments you keep your projects simple and clean. This ensures that each enviroment can have its own set of dependencies and modules without disrupting any of other projects
Let's create a virtual enviroment now to get started we need to install the python3-env package
`sudo apt-get install python3-venv`
Now we can create a virtual enviroment. Let's make a new directory to work in and create the enviroment

`mkdir bhp`
`cd bhp`
`python3 -m venv venv3`
`source venv3/bin/activate`

That creates a new directory, bhp in the current directory we create a new virtual enviroment by calling venv package with -m switch and the name you want the new enviroment to have
Next we activate the enviroment by running the activate script. Later on when you're ready to exit the enviroment, use the command `deactivate`

You can search for packages and install them into your virtual enviroment with pip
`pip search hashcrack`

Let's do a quick test and install the lxml module, which we'll use in chapter 5 to build a web scraper
`pip install lxml`

You should see output in your terminal indicating that the library is being downloaded and installed. Then drop into a python shell and calidate that it was installed correctly
## Installing an IDE
An integrated development enviroment (IDE) provides a set of tools for coding. Typically it includes a code editor with syntax highlighting and automatic lintingn, and debugger. The purpose of the IDE is to make it easier to cde and debug your programs

+ You can install PyCharm
+ You can install VS Code from the kali command line `apt-get install code`, Or to get the latest version of VS Code, download it, and install with `apt-get install -f ./code..deb`

## Code Hygiene
No matter what you use to wirte your programs, it is a good idea to follow a code-formatting guideline. A code style guide provides recommendations to improve te readability and consistency of your python code. It makes it easier for you decide to share it. The python community has a such a guideline, called PEP 8. You can read the full PEP 8 guide here: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

All the top of our program, we import the packages we need. The first import block 1 is in the form of from xxxx import yyy type. Each import line is in alphabetical order

The same holds true for the module imports, they too are in alphabetical order 2. This ordering lets you see at a glance whether you've imported a package without reading every line of imports and it ensures that you don't import a package twice. The intent is to keep you code clean and lessen the amount you have to think when you reread you code

Next come the function 3, the class definitions 4,if you have any. Some coders prefer to never have classes and rely only on functions. There's no hard-and-fast rule here, but if you find you're trying to maintain state with global variables or passing the same data structures to several functions, that may be an indication that your program would be easier to understand if you refactor it to use a class

Finally , the main block at the bottom 5 gives you the opportunity to use your code in 2ways. FIrst you can use it from the command line. In this case, the module's internal name is \_\_main\_\_ and the main block is executed. 
For example if the name of the file containing the code is scan.py you could invoke it from the command line as follows
`python scan.py`
This will load the functions and classes in scan.py and execute the main block. You would see the response hello on the console.
Second you can import your code into another programwith no side effects. For example you would import the code with
`import scan`

"sinceitsinternal name" is the name of the python module, scan, and not \_\_main\_\_, you  have access to all the module's defined functions and classes, but he main block is not executed
You'll also notice we avoid variables with generic names. The better you get at naming your variables, the easier it will be to understand the program.
